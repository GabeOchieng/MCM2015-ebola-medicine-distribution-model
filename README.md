#Modelling the Spread of the Ebola Virus in West Africa

This github repo contains all of the code generated by our team for question A of the 
2015 MCM competition - see http://www.comap-math.com/mcm/ for more context. 

We attempted to model the spread of Ebola in West Africa using a multi-level, stochastic, 
state-based approach, which we feel captured many of the complex issues in this area
that would affect the spread of this disease. We quickly discovered that these issues
were very difficult to quantify, and as such the parameter space of this model
grews quite rapidly.

THIS CODE SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES. It was all generated over
the course of 96 hours. 

See http://www.gleamviz.org/ for another implementation of such a model. It is much more
polished than this code, but does not allow for some of the added complexity we desired.
